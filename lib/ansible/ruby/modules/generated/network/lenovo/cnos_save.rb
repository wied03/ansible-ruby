      # This module allows you to copy the running configuration of a switch over its startup configuration. It is recommended to use this module shortly after any major configuration changes so they persist after a switch restart. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.
