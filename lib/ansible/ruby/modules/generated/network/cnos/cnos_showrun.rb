      # This module allows you to view the switch running configuration. It executes the display running-config CLI command on a switch and returns a file containing the current running configuration of the target network device. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.
